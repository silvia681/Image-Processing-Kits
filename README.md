# Image-Processing-Kits##My image processing kits include the following algorithms:1. thresholding: mannual, otsu method, entropy method2. edge detection: Roberts operator, Prewitt operator, Sobel operator3. noise reduction: Gaussian filter, median filter4. binary operation: dilation, erosion, opening, closing5. distance transform: chessboard, city block6. skeleton: chessboard, city block, restoration7. grayscale operation: dilation, erosion, opening, closing8. mathematical morphology: morphological edge (standard/external/internal), gradient (standard/external/internal), conditional dilation, grascale reconstruction (OBR/CBR)## Runtime Environment```Windows 8 + VS 2012 + Qt 5.4```##About GUI:You can click on "switch" to process your image in sequence. "step" button is used for skeleton restoration.## LicenseMIT
